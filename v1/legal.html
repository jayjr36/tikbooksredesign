            PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you

            Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective
            party&rsquo;s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class
            member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple
            plaintiff, or similar proceeding (&ldquo;Class Action&rdquo;). The
            parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in
            any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator
            will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or
            conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity
            not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this
            Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or
            voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction
            and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to
            litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to
            be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that
            any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.
          </p>
          
          <p class="data-p">
            If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the
            entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will
            be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
            relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only
            to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
            party&apos;s individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in
            court rather than in arbitration, you and Brandon Haneline each waive any right
            to a jury trial.
